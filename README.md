# SSHOC WP3 Conversion Hub

Drupal setup for the conversion hub for deployment on ACDH-CH production server. Includes composer (/composer) and configuration files (/sync) to set up Drupal and the adapted theme (/theme/bootstrap_conversionhub) for the project.
Additionally, there is a Symfony based quick'n dirty import script for data collected (by members of SSHOC WP3 T3.5) into a spreadsheet (/import_spreadsheet) and based on this the mapping for the migrate module of Drupal (/drupal-migration-templates), to import the data into Drupal.
